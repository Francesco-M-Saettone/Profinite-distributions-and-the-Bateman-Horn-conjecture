# Profinite-distributions-and-the-Bateman-Horn-conjecture

Let $N$ and $Z$ denote the natural numbers and the integers respectively. We have tested our conjecture  in the particular case where $k=1$ and $\phi(x)=x+2$, which turns it into the more specific  Twin Primes Conjecture, by numerical experiments which do not disprove it, but involving an unexpectedly high number of twin primes for the  small quotients which have been involved.  Define
```math
S:=\phi^{-1}(\widehat{Z}^{\times}).
```
If $\phi_n$ is the projection of $\widehat{Z}$ onto $Z/nZ$ for some $n\in N$, we call
```math
S_n:=\pi_n(S).
```
More specifically
```math
S_n=\{a\in Z/nZ\text{ such that }a, a+2\in (Z/nZ)^{\times}\}.
```
If our conjecture  is true, then $S_n$ should be contained in the projection modulo $n$ of all the twin primes, for all natural $n$ bigger than $1$. We have verified this fact for $n=k!$, where $k\le10$. The software we used is Python and the list of twin primes was generated by the computer as well using a list of the first prime numbers up to 1 billion. This turned out to be necessary already for $k=8$. We describe the code here below.
