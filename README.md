# Profinite-distributions-and-the-Bateman-Horn-conjecture

Let $N$ and $Z$ denote the natural numbers and the integers respectively. We have tested our conjecture  in the particular case of the twin primes conjecture, i.e. for $k=1$ and $\phi=(f_1,f_2)$, where $f_1(x)=x$ and $f_2(x)=x+2$. Our numerical experiments (which indeed do not disprove it) involve an unexpectedly high number of twin primes for the  small quotients which have been involved.  Define
```math
S:=\phi^{-1}(\hat{Z}^{*}).
```
If $\phi_n$ is the projection of $\widehat{Z}$ onto $Z/nZ$ for some $n\in N$, we call
```math
S_n:=\pi_n(S).
```
More specifically
```math
S_n=\{a\in Z/nZ\;:\;a, a+2\in (Z/nZ)^{*}\}.
```
If our conjecture  is true, then $S_n$ should be contained in the projection modulo $n$ of all the twin primes, for all natural $n$ bigger than $1$. We have verified this fact for $n=k!$, where $k\le10$. The software we used is Python and the list of twin primes was generated by the computer as well using a list of the first prime numbers up to 1 billion. This turned out to be necessary already for $k=8$.
